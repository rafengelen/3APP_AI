    "frequently use this tool to order the search results by relevance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simply put, the Term Frequency (tf) is basically a measure of how frequently each word appears in a given document. It is the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document. Every document has its own term frequency. The second part of the statistic is the Inverse Document Frequency (idf), which is a measure of how unique a word is to this document in the given set of documents.\n",
