    "# Python Libraries for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Python really shines in the field of machine learning. Its combination of consistent syntax, shorter development time and flexibility makes it well-suited to developing sophisticated models and prediction engines that can plug directly into production systems. One of Pythonâ€™s greatest assets is its extensive set of Machine Learning libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four important Machine Learning libraries are listed below. In the following Jupyter Notebooks of this lesson (*3. NumPy, 4. Pandas* and *5. Matplotlib*) you will find a short introduction to three libraries. __I suggest you skip these Notebooks (3, 4 and 5) for now.__ The libraries will be explained at the same time as when the machine learning techniques are discussed. If you then need additional explanation, you can still go through these Notebooks afterwards."
