    "Have you ever wondered how Netflix suggests movies to you based on the movies you have already watched? Or how does an e-commerce website display options such as \"Frequently Bought Together\"? They may look relatively simple options but behind the scenes, a *complex* statistical algorithm executes in order to predict these recommendations. Such systems are called Recommender Systems, Recommendation Systems, or Recommendation Engines. A Recommender System is one of the most famous applications of data science and machine learning.\n",

The trending list you see in YouTube or Netflix is based on this algorithm. It keeps track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order (highest view count to lowest view count). Pretty simple, but effective."
