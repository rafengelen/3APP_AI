    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an **agent** to learn in an interactive **environment** by trial and error using feedback from its own **actions and experiences**. Some AI experts believe Reinforcement Learning is the most viable strategy for achieving human or superhuman Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Below you can find two (fun) examples of what Reinforcement Learning is capable of."

    "To test Gym, OpenAI made an environment, where agents play a team-based hide-and-seek game. Hiders (blue) are tasked with avoiding line-of-sight from the seekers (red), and seekers are tasked with keeping vision of the hiders. There are objects scattered throughout the environment that hiders and seekers can grab and lock in place. Before the game begins, hiders are given a preparation phase where seekers are immobilized to give hiders a chance to run away or change their environment. \n",

AlphaGo's algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques, combined with extensive training, both from human and computer play. Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency, it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself, using Reinforcement Learning to improve its play.\n",
