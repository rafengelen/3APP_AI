    "Most of you have probably heard of AI learning to play computer games on their own, a very popular example being Deepmind. Deepmind hit the news when their AlphaGo program defeated the South Korean Go world champion in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "There had been many successful attempts in the past to develop agents with the intent of playing Atari games like Breakout, Pong, and Space Invaders. Each of these programs follows a paradigm of Machine Learning known as Reinforcement Learning, which this lesson will be all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson we will use Reinforcement Learning to learn a computer to drive up a mountain."

The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the carâ€™s engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.\n",
