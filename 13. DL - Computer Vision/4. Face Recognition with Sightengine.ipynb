    "## 1. Understanding how Face Recognition works\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Machine Learning algorithm takes a dataset as input and learns from this data. The algorithm goes through the data and identifies patterns in the data. For instance, suppose we wish to identify whose face is present in a given image, there are multiple things we can look at as a pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Height of face (cm): 23.1\n",
    "- Width of face (cm): 15.8\n",
    "- Average color of face (R, G, B): (255, 224, 189)\n",
    "- Width of lips (cm): 5.2\n",
    "- Height of nose (cm): 4.4\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/fr.png\" style=\"height: 250px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our image is now a vector that could be represented as (23.1, 15.8, 255, 224, 189, 5.2, 4.4). Of course there could be countless other features that could be derived from the image (for instance, hair color, facial hair, spectacles, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, once we have encoded each image into a feature vector, the problem becomes much simpler. Clearly, when we have 2 faces (images) that represent the same person, the feature vectors derived will be quite similar. Put it the other way, the *distance* between the 2 feature vectors will be quite small."
